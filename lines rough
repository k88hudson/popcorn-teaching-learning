Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be / What thou art promised: yet do I fear thy nature;
You are thane of Glamis and Cawdor, and you’re going to be king, just like you were promised. But I worry about whether or not you have what it takes to seize the crown.
5->26

It is too full o' the milk of human kindness / To catch the nearest way:
You are too full of the milk of human kindness to strike aggressively at your first opportunity. 
26->31

Hie thee hither, / That I may pour my spirits in thine ear; / And chastise with the valour of my tongue / All that impedes thee from the golden round,
Hurry home so I can persuade you and talk you out of whatever’s keeping you from going after the crown. 
33->43

Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem / To have thee crown'd withal. / After all, fate and witchcraft both seem to want you to be king.
Enter a Messenger
44->50

What is your tidings? / What news do you bring?
52->54

The king comes here to-night.
The king is coming here tonight.
56->58

LADY MACBETH
Thou'rt mad to say it: / Is not thy master with him? who, were't so, / Would have inform'd for preparation.
You must be crazy to say that! Isn’t Macbeth with the king, and wouldn’t Macbeth have told me in advance so I could prepare, if the king were really coming?
59->1:06

So please you, it is true: our thane is coming: / One of my fellows had the speed of him, / Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more / Than would make up his message.
I’m sorry, but it’s the truth. Macbeth is coming. He sent a messenger ahead of him who arrived here so out of breath that he could barely speak his message.
1.06->1:12

Give him tending; / He brings great news.
Take good care of him. He brings great news.
1:15->1:18
75->78

Exit Messenger
1.18->1:17
78->79

The raven himself is hoarse / That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan / Under my battlements.
1:21->1:30
81->90

Come, you spirits / That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here, / And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full / Of direst cruelty! 
1:31->1:45
90->105

Make thick my blood; / Stop up the access and passage to remorse, / That no compunctious visitings of nature / Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between / The effect and it!
1:45->1:57
105->117

Come to my woman's breasts,
And take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers,
Wherever in your sightless substances
You wait on nature's mischief!
1:57->2:10

Come, thick night,
And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,
That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,
2:10->2:22
Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark,
To cry 'Hold, hold!'
2:22->2:29
Enter MACBETH
2:29->2:31

Great Glamis! worthy Cawdor!
3:31->3:36
Greater than both, by the all-hail hereafter!
Thy letters have transported me beyond
This ignorant present, and I feel now
The future in the instant.
3:36->2:52
MACBETH
My dearest love,
Duncan comes here to-night.
2:52->2:57
LADY MACBETH
And when goes hence?
2:57->2:59
MACBETH
To-morrow, as he purposes.
2:59->3:01
LADY MACBETH
O, never
Shall sun that morrow see!
3:01->3:06
Your face, my thane, is as a book where men
May read strange matters.
3:07->3:14

To beguile the time,
Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye,
Your hand, your tongue: look like the innocent flower,
But be the serpent under't.
3:14->3:30

He that's coming
Must be provided for: and you shall put
This night's great business into my dispatch;
3:30->3:39

Which shall to all our nights and days to come
Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.
3:39->3:47
MACBETH
We will speak further.
3:46
LADY MACBETH
Only look up clear;
3:47
To alter favour ever is to fear:
Leave all the rest to me.
3:57
Exeunt
